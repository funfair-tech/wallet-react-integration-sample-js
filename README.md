This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project shows how you can integrate the fun wallet with a react app. It uses our react package in the examples which you can install and use [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@funfair-tech/wallet-react).

Full documentation is available on how you can integrate is [here](https://funfair-tech.github.io/fun-wallet-docs/guide/web-sdk/installing-sdk.html)

## Install

`bash $ npm install $ npm start `

This will load the app on http://localhost:3001

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
